* auth_u2f
This is an Odoo ([[https://odoo.com][website]], [[https://github.com/odoo/odoo][GitHub]]) module implementing two-factor
authentication through U2F. This module is meant for Odoo 11, which is
the most recent LTS version.
** How to use
After logging in set up a U2F device through the user preferences:

[[doc/preferences.png]]

Click on 'Manage 2-step verification':

[[doc/change_my_preferences.png]]

Click 'Create', fill in a name and scan your device.

Afterwards a system administrator can view and administer U2F devices
in the U2F tab of the user form view accessible through Settings >
Users & Companies > Users.
** Notes
- Currently this has only been tested with Google Chrome. Firefox
  supports U2F partially and will be supported by this module
  eventually.
- U2F requires HTTPS, it does not work over HTTP.
